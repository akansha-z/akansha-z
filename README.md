Hi! My name is Akansha and welcome to my GitHub 

I am passionate about Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Data Visualization, and am currently exploring the world of open-source programming. I thrive in extracting insights from data and using visuals to tell compelling stories, and I am constantly seeking to improve my skills in this domain.

Art & Technology Enthusiast:

I believe in the power of creativity and technology working together. I am particularly interested in the intersection between art and technologyâ€”a field I have begun exploring through Blender, which allows me to visualize ideas in new and innovative ways. I am excited to deepen my knowledge in this area, combining aesthetics and tech to push the boundaries of both fields.

Finance & Fintech:

In addition to tech, I have a growing interest in finance, particularly in how technology is reshaping the financial industry, also known as Fintech. I am dedicated to learning more about personal finance and money management and I am actively seeking resources that explore this fascinating intersection. I am also focused on improving my proficiency with tools like Tableau and have begun diving into Power BI to enhance my skills in financial data visualization and analysis.

Leadership & Initiative:

I take pride in taking initiative, especially in group tasks. I have been actively involved in various college associations, including: Alexa Developers, Computing Technology Association and Directorate of Student Affairs.
Through these associations, I have gained valuable experience in event management and public speaking, hosting both technical and non-technical events. These opportunities have sharpened my organizational skills and allowed me to develop a strong presence in front of diverse audiences.

Thank you for stopping by, and feel free to connect if you share similar interests or want to collaborate on exciting projects!
